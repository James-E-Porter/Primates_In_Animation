# Primates_In_Animation
A look at primates that have appeared in animation.

This is an analysis of Primates in animation.  This project was meant to satisfy my questions on how often primates were included in cartoons/anime.  I wanted to see what kind of information I could get.

### Source
I used wikipedia.  It has a wonderful page dedicated to exactly what I was looking for.

### The first Notebook

The first notebook titled Primates In Animation Part 1 was used to document the process of extracting the data and cleaning it up.
I used python for this and found the process to be quite smooth.
